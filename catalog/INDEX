description "GNU swbis is a software administration system for
GNU/Linux systems and systems that are UNIX system-like. It implements
the Open Group's CAE Spec C701 (XDSA) Distributed Software Administration.
This spec closely follows ISO/IEC 15068-2:1999 (now withdrawn) which was
identical to IEEE 1387.2:1995.  The implementation relies on POSIX
functionality as provided by a typical GNU system.  It has security
enhancement extensions that use GNU Privacy Guard.  It provides
distributed functionality by direct use of the client ssh program and
matches the administration functionality of RPM or dpkg without any
new utilities required on the target hosts."
