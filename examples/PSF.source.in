# File: PSF.source.in -- Input for swign version 0.480 or later
#  This file may be copied without restriction.
#
#  This file is intended to be processed by 'swign'.
#  Example:
#  swign -s PSF.in --show-psf
#       -or-
#  swign -s PSF.in -u "GPG Name" @- >../mysignedtarball
#
#  All instances of %__keyword PSF.in are replaced by the
#  value of 'keyword' by the 'swign' program.
#  'swign' determines these values from the name of ".",
#  the current directory which should have dash '-'
#  delimited NAME and REVISION parts.
#  The replaceable keywords are : revision, and tag
#  Replacement is called for when a 'sed' filter sees the
#  special pattern %__keyword. 
#
#  To use this file with swpackage(8), replace the %__keyword
#  tags for product.tag and product.revision with the desired
#  actual values, swpackage does not process these macros.

# Top level object
distribution
 
# Attributes in the distribution are mostly ignored although
# distributor control files that pertain to the distribution
# as a whole are properly placed here.  Two examples of files
# that are useful here are:

  # AUTHORS < AUTHORS   # This places the file in ./catalog/dfiles
  # COPYING < COPYING   # This places the file in ./catalog/dfiles

# This places the checkdigest script in ./catalog/dfiles/checkdigest
# For a description of the checkdigest script see the info document for
# 'swbis', type: info swbis, and the swign and swverify man pages.

  checkdigest  < bin/checkdigest.sh

# The vendor object provides attributes to describe
# the distributor.  At this time, how these attributes
# are used is not addressed.

# vendor
#    the_term_vendor_is_misleading True
#    tag fw01
#    title fooware widget
#    description "A multiline
# description"

# Most packages do not need a bundle.  At this point in swbis'
# development 'bundles' are mostly ignored.  Bundles are meta
# packages, it is an object that contains other bundles and
# products whether included in this distribution tarball or not.
# The bundle tag value appears in the installed software catalog
# directory hierarchy.

# bundle
#   tag somepackage

# The product object contains the attributes of common
# interest such as the description, version and name.

product
   description "A single or multi-line description"
   tag %__tag               # This is the package NAME
   revision %__revision     # This is the package VERSION
   # vendor_tag fw01        # Associating a vendor is optional
   title "fooware somepackage"
   control_directory ""   # Empty string, Important

# The fileset object contains the files.  The tag, revision,
# and description attributes are mostly ignored.
# At this time swbis supports only one (1) fileset.

# file_permissions:
# Here is an important policy.  This will cause 'swpackage'
# to create the tar achive with all files owned by uid and
# gid zero (0), the user name 'root' will not be included
# in the uname and gname tar header fields.  This is similar
# to the effect of GNU tar options --numeric --owner=root
# --group=root .
# To use the name and ids of the source files delete the line
# or reset the file_permissions adding after or changing to:
#    file_permissions -u 000
# 
# NOTE:  Using "file_permissions -o 0 -g 0"  is preferred
# because it will allow the end user to more easily verify
# the directory (unpacked) form of the package using standard
# non-swbis tools. 

#   file_permissions -u 000  # To use ownerships of source files
    file_permissions -o 0 -g 0 # To set all ownerships to 0/0

# The following two (2) lines mean include every file in the current
# directory.
