.PP
This script was named \&'checksig\&'\&.  As of 2006-03-28, the name of this script should be \&'checkdigest\&'\&.
The name \&'checksig\&' should be considered deprecated for new packages\&. 
.PP
A software distributor may choose to provide a \fBcheckdigest \fPscript\&.
The \fBcheckdigest \fP script is part of the distribution object\&.
It is used to verify the directory form of a distribution  (as distinguished
from installed_software)\&.  The verified attributes are the same as those verified
from the archive file form with the addition of the distribution file list\&.
In addition the script may chose to verify the \fIadjunct_md5sum\fP and file\&.md5 digests and symbolic links\&.
Due to the constraints of reproducing the archive message digests 
from the directory, which include tar utility dependence and file owner/group specification, 
this script may not be useful to all distributors\&.
.SS "Execution Environment"
 The script may require the SW_CONTROL_TAG environment variable be set to "checkdigest" or "checkfile"
and if not exit with failure\&.
swverify will set this variable to "checkfile" if the --scm or --cvs option is
used, and otherwise to "checkdigest"\&.  The script may take different action based on the value\&.
Currently, the checkdigest script used by the swbis source package will omit the archive digests
checks if set to SW_CONTROL_TAG="checkfile" since reproducing the archive digest is not possible
when the package is exported from CVS due to file system meta-data non-preservation\&. In this case
the file list is checked and the md5 and sha1 digests are verified for each regular file\&.
.SH "VERIFYING SIGNATURES"
.PP
The design separates the payload and catalog, therefore,
verification requires verifying the storage section md5 and sha1
message digests and then verifying the signature of the catalog\&.
Naturally, it is required that the signed data include the storage
section message digests and that they match the storage sections\&.
The storage section digests are stored as separate attribute files
in the dfiles catalog directory\&.
.PP
The 
\fBchecksig\fP (i\&.e\&. swverify -d @-) mode verifies a tarballs embedded signature\&.
This mode checks all the security files in the package and
is the preferred way to authenticate a package\&.
The \fBemit-signed-file\fP,
\fBemit-digest-file\fP modes are useful for testing, sanity checks 
and custom applications\&.
The \fBget-sig-if\fP is the function used when verifying a tarball\&. 
.SS "Verifying a POSIX Distribution Archive Manually"
.PP
The design of the authentication attributes supports manual verification of
the archive file (e\&.g\&. tarball) form of the distribution, that is verification
take place on the uncompressed archive using \&'gpg\&', GNU \&'tar\&' and the swbis
utility \&'swverify\&' (or the library utility \&'arf2arf\&')\&.

3) Obtain the message digest (md5, sha1,) contained in the

4) Recreate the digest byte stream and present to the appropriate
   hash generation program to generate the message digest\&.
5) Compare the digest message generated in step 4 to the

Verifying the unpacked tarball package form\&.
.PP
The design of the authentication attributes supports manual verification of
the directory (unpacked) form of the distribution, that is verification
takes place on the leading package directory and its contents\&. It should
be noted that it is left to the user to verify that the archive 
installed no files outside of this directory as this would likely indicate
a trojan\&'ed package\&.
.PP
If authenticating on a GNU/Linux system using GNU tar it is possible
to validate the archive message digests and signature if the
following are true: 

.PP
.nf
\f(CW1) The package file is a tar archive\&.
2) The installed version of GNU tar produces archives with
   bit-for-bit sameness relative to the swpackage(8) utility
   that generated the signature and message digests\&.  For packages
   made with swbis versions >= 0\&.474 and with format option "ustar"
   you will need GNU tar 1\&.14 or 1\&.15\&.*
3) The package has a single leading package directory, like a source
   package\&.
4) The package catalog contains the \&'checkdigest\&' script\&.
5) The package catalog contains the distribution file list\&.
6) The ownership names are present and have the same uid\&'s and gid\&'s\&.
7) The package was unpacked with a version of tar that
   preserves all file times\&.  Use for example "tar xpf"\&.\fR
.fi
.PP
.PP
In this example, the package has a single path name prefix called, \fBnamedir\fP and
the file owner/group are root\&.  These restrictions are suited to
source packages\&.
.br
 Verify the signature:
.PP
.nf
\f(CW  #!/bin/sh
  tar cf - -b1 --owner=root --group=root \\
  --exclude=namedir/catalog/dfiles/signature  \\
  namedir/catalog | gpg --verify namedir/catalog/dfiles/signature -\fR
.fi
.PP
If this fails try using GNU tar option --posix\&.
If this fails then, try experimenting with the owner, group, and
numeric-id options\&.
If you are unable to verify a tar byte stream using gpg(1)
that contains the storage section message digests, then the package
cannot be authenticated\&.

.PP
Assuming you successfully verified the catalog as shown above, now generate
the message digest and compare it to the md5sum file attribute from
the same byte stream that gpg(1) claims is authenticate\&.
.PP
.nf
\f(CW  #!/bin/sh

  tar cf - -b1 --owner=root --group=root \\
  --exclude=namedir/catalog/dfiles/signature  \\
  namedir/catalog | tar xf - -O  namedir/catalog/dfiles/md5sum\fR
.fi
.PP
Likewise for the sha1 digest\&.
.PP
If the package has symbolic links, Verify the adjunct_md5sum:
.PP
.nf
\f(CW  #!/bin/sh
  grep -v namedir/catalog  namedir/catalog/dfiles/files | \\
  ( while read file; do if [ ! -h $file ]; then echo $file; fi done; )|\\
  tar cf - -b1 --owner=root --group=root \\
  --no-recursion --files-from=- | md5sum
  cat namedir/catalog/dfiles/adjunct_md5sum\fR
.fi
.PP
The symbolic link files must be verified manually by comparing to the INFO file
information\&.
.SS "Verifying a POSIX distribution in tar format"
.PP
Below is output from successful authentication\&.  The authentication requires
checking the archive md5 message digest (and sha1 if present)\&.
All present message digests must succeed and if this is true then
the signed file is written and gpg proceeds to check the signature\&.
If the \fBsig_header\fP file is present then the requirement 
that its data be identical to the ustar header of every signature file is
enforced\&.
If any one of these checks fails, authentication fails\&.

.SS "Verifying the Directory Form of a Distribution"
.PP
Authenticating using \&'swverify\&' is subject to the same constraints as
verifying manually using GNU tools because swverify implements this using GNU tools\&.

\&'swverify\&' when verifying the directory form of a distribution attempts to
authenticate the exported catalog signature\&.  If it is successful it executes the \&'checkdigest\&'
script found in the \&'catalog/dfiles\&' directory of the exported
catalog\&.  If the \&'checkdigest\&' script does not exist, authentication fails\&. \&'swverify\&'
will only attempt to run the \&'checkdigest\&' script if it is found in the dfiles directory of
an authenticated catalog\&.

\&'swverify\&' currently has no provision to verify the archive section (i\&.e\&. the
file storage structure) of a directory (unpacked) form of a POSIX distribution\&.
It is the role of the checkdigest script to do this\&.

For example, if filemypackage-00\&.1 is a directory unpacked with a tar reading utility
that preserved file times then try,

.PP
.nf
\f(CW   #!/bin/sh
   swverify --checksig mypackage-00\&.1\fR

 or change directory into mypackage-00\&.1

.SH "BUGS"
.PP
The signature file\&'s archive header (or data) is not part of the signed
data therefore it may be subject to undetectable tampering, however, swverify
does perform sanity checks on the pathname, permissions and filetype if
the \fBsig_header\fP file (See sw(5) manual page\&.) is not present
[due to being signed by a old swpackage version], and if \fBsig_header\fP is present, swverify requires that it match the sig file header\&.
The ability to verify the unpacked directory
form of the package depends on many factors not immediately obvious, among them are the
tar header uname and gname, and whether they are preserved by the reading utility,
and whether these names are in the system database files
/etc/passwd and /etc/group, and if so, whether they assign the same uid/gid as
the package\&.
.PP
Verification of the directory form of a distribution (i\&.e\&. the installed tarball
path name prefix) such as running \&'swverify -d @\&.\&' after running \&'swign @\&.\&' 
will fail if the order of directory entries is not compatible with
traditional Unix file system directory entry ordering, which is the order of file creation\&.
This ordering is almost always apparent on Ext2 file system for small directories (but not
always for big directories)\&.  Ext3, reiserFS, and DarwinOS et\&.al file systems do not have
this ordering, use of the \&'--order-catalog\&' option is therefore required\&.
Use of the \&'--cvs\&' or \&'--order-catalog\&' options is theoretically problematic
because it causes the use and interpretation of data in the verification of that
same data therefore opening possible attack vectors\&.
