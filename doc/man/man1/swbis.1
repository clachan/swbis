.SH "INTRODUCTION"
.PP
This manual page is a very short user manual\&. It provides basic examples for using the swbis utilities\&.
For detailed description of format, syntax, and internal structures see the swbis Info document
(run \&'info swbis\&' or \&'info -f doc/info/swbis\&.info\&' from within the source package) or
other manual pages: sw(5), swpackage(5), swbis(7)\&.
Each utility has its own manual page, see swverify(8), swlist(8), swcopy(8), swinstall(8) and swpackage(8)\&.
For configuration help and host compatibility issues see swbis(7)\&. 
.PP
swbis is a software administration system for GNU/Linux systems and systems that are UNIX system-like\&.
It implements the Open Group\&'s CAE Spec C701 (XDSA) Distributed Software Administration\&.
This spec closely follows ISO/IEC 15068-2:1999 (now withdrawn) which was identical to IEEE 1387\&.2:1995\&.
The scope of the implementation includes a package format, meta-data file format, and utilities
for package creation, installation, query, listing, and verification\&.  The package management utilities
are network transparent via direct use of ssh(1)\&.  They provide remote package management functions
to any UNIX-like remote host with a zero footprint regardless if swbis is installed on the remote host\&. 
.PP
While the swbis system has features comparable with package managers, it has features that are of
general purpose usefulness to system administrators and developers\&.
These include host-to-host copying of file system directories, advanced tarball creation methods,
backward compatibility with uses of plain tarballs, and the ability to act as a
directory content integrity checker and SCM security tool\&.  
.PP
All sections of this manual page, except the last two, describe security related application of
\fBswpackage\fP that integrate GNU utilities and the file system\&.
These applications along with the \fBswign\fP utility are unique to swbis\&.
The last section, Package Management, represents the intended focus of the spec\&.
.SH "MAKING A PACKAGE SPECIFICATION FILE (PSF)"
.PP
A PSF is a simple text file that directs \fBswpackage\fP on what to package\&. It is not included in
the package unless it lists itself as a file to include\&.
It can contain extra attributes (that swbis would not recognize)\&.  These end up in the 
main meta-data file named \fBcatalog/INDEX\fP\&.  A PSF consists of sections that
contain keyword/value pairs\&.  The same keywords may appear in different sections and are indeed different
and separate attributes but they have the same definition/usage\&.  The sections are delimited by the
section keyword (which is recognized because it has no value) and the next section keyword\&.
The sections are properly called objects and the keyword is the object keyword\&.
Some sections contain other sections\&.  The parser knows and enforces the hierarchy\&.
.PP
White space in the PSF is not significant\&. A comment begins with a pound \&'#\&'\&.
.PP
Simple PSF\&'s can be generated with \fBswign\fP\&.
.PP
.nf
\f(CW# Generate some generic sample PSFs
swign --show-psf -s\&. 
swign --show-psf -s\&. --revision 1\&.1

\f(CWswign --show-psf -s\&.  | swpackage -p -v -s -\fR
.fi
.PP
.SS "PSFs By Example"
.PP
To test or preview the following examples use swpackage as follows:
.PP

.PP
.SH "MAKING ARCHIVES"
.PP
swbis provide two programs to make a package: \fBswpackage\fP and \fBswign\fP To make a package, take your PSF that you created and use it as input to these programs\&.  Be aware that
both write to standard output by default\&. 
.SS "Using swpackage"
.PP
\fBswpackage\fP is a self-contained tar writing utility, that is it writes a
tar archive without using /bin/tar\&. 
.PP
Here is the command to read a PSF from stdin and write a tar archive on stdout and list
the resulting package with tar\&.
.PP
.nf
\f(CW   swpackage -s - @- | tar tvf -
   swpackage --gzip -s - @- | tar ztvf -
   swpackage --bzip2 -s - @- | tar jtvf -\fR
.fi
.PP
.br
Here are the options to use to include security attributes\&.  These can be set in your
defaults file (~/\&.swbis/swbisdefaults)\&.
.PP
.nf
\f(CW   swpackage -s - --archive-digests --file-digests --files @-\fR
.fi
.PP
.br
The default digests for these options are md5 and sha1\&.  To add sha512 digests do
.PP
.nf
\f(CW   swpackage -s - --archive-sha512 --archive-digests \\
	--file-digests --file-sha512 --files @-\fR
.fi
.PP
.br
.PP
To sign the package, that is, include an embedded GPG signature just
add the \&'--sign\&' option, along with other options\&.  \&'--sign\&' turns on \&'--archive-digest\&'
.PP
.nf
\f(CW   swpackage \\
      --archive-digests --file-digests --files \\
      --gpg-name=yourId --gpg-path=~/\&.gnupg --sign\fR
.fi
.PP
.br
.PP
When swpackage asks for a passphrase it is really swpackage\&.
Although care is taken to handle the passphrase correctly, you can avoid having
swpackage handle your passphrase all together by using the gpg agent\&.
.PP
To use the agent, it must be running and the location must be set as the environment
variable \fBGPG_AGENT_INFO\fP\&. To verify this try:
.PP
.nf
\f(CW   env | grep GPG\fR
.fi
.PP
.br
Now, just add the option \fB--passphrase-fd=agent\fP to the swpackage invocation
or set and export the environment variable SWPACKAGEPASSFD=agent\&.  The result should be that
swpacakge completes without asking for a passphrase at the terminal\&.
.SS "Using swign"
.PP
The \fBswign\fP utility is designed to make a package directly from
the contents of the current directory\&.  It combines usage of GNU tar and swpackage such
that the archive it creates is written entirely by GNU tar using the  
file list, \fBcatalog/dfiles/files\fP, generated by swpackage\&.  In this
way it provides more assurance against unseen data corruption, which is important when
creating signed packages\&.
.PP
For directories whose name has the form \fBName-Version\fP, swign will
properly generate its own PSF with attributes based on the directory name\&.  The
name \&'\&.\&' is the special name for the internally generated PSF\&. By default, swign will
read a PSF from standard input\&.
.PP
.nf
\f(CW   cd somepackage-1\&.1
   swign -s\&. -u yourIdName @- | tar tvf -\fR
.fi
.PP
.br
The result is a package that looks like this
.PP
.nf
\f(CWsomepackage-1\&.1/
somepackage-1\&.1/catalog/
somepackage-1\&.1/catalog/INDEX
somepackage-1\&.1/catalog/dfiles/
somepackage-1\&.1/catalog/dfiles/INFO
somepackage-1\&.1/catalog/dfiles/md5sum

somepackage-1\&.1/catalog/dfiles/signature
somepackage-1\&.1/catalog/pfiles/
somepackage-1\&.1/catalog/pfiles/INFO
somepackage-1\&.1/catalog/INFO
  \&.\&.\&.
somepackage-1\&.1/ \&.\&.\fR
.fi
.PP
.br
.PP
When making a package with swign, it is beneficial to include the \fBcheckdigest\fP control script using this option:
.PP
.nf
\f(CW    swign -D $HOME/checkdigest\&.sh -s\&. -u yourIdName @- | tar tvf -
    
    # Aside:
    # To see how the script is specified in the PSF, try
    #     swign -D /your_secure_path/checkdigest\&.sh -s\&. --psf
    #\fR
.fi
.PP
.br
This script will work unchanged for any package, and is available in the swbis source package\&. It may
be copied as a public domain program\&.  With this script included, a recipient of your signed package can
verify the unpacked directory using \fBswverify\fP\&.
 
.SH "VERIFYING ARCHIVES"
.PP
Packages are verified by \fBswverify\fP
.PP
.nf
\f(CW   # This example verifies standard input
   swverify -d @- \fR
.fi
.PP
.br
.PP
In addition, packages that have a single path prefix (like source packages) and that
have ownerships reproducible on the local host can be verified in its unpacked form, for example:
.PP
.nf
\f(CW   tar zxpf somepackage-1\&.1\&.tar\&.gz
   cd somepackage-1\&.1
   swverify -d @\&.\fR
.fi
.PP
.br
Verifying the unpacked form requires the \fBcheckdigest\fP implementation
extension control script\&.  This script must have been included when the package was created using
the \&'-D NAME\&' option in the \fBswign\fP\&.
 
.SH "TRANSLATING OTHER FORMATS"
.PP
swpackage can translate other package formats: deb, rpm, and slackware, and plain vanilla
source tarballs with a NAME-VERSION path name prefix\&.  In the process, the package can be signed\&.
.PP
The converted package is written to stdout\&.  The input is read from standard input or specified as
source using the \fB-s FILENAME\fP option\&.  Slackware packages cannot be read from standard
input because the revision and name is determined from the \&.tgz filename itself\&.
.PP
.nf
\f(CW   swpackage --to-swbis -s somepackage\&.rpm  # RPM
   swpackage --to-swbis -s somepackage\&.deb  # DEB
   swpackage --to-swbis -s somesourcepackage-1\&.0\&.tar\&.gz  # Plain Source Package
     # or for slackware packages
   swpackage -s somepackage-1\&.0-i386\&.tgz --to-swbis\fR
.fi
.PP
.br
 
.SH "SECURING FILE SYSTEM DIRECTORIES"
.PP
The \fBswign\fP utility can be used as a directory content integrity tool\&.  After
processing the current directory with swign, the directory can be verified against changes
to file contents, ownerships and permissions\&.
.PP
In this capacity, the \fB\&./catalog/\fP directory is a GPG signed record of
the directory contents\&.  It is created this way:
.PP
.nf
\f(CW    swign -D $HOME/checkdigest\&.sh -s\&. -u yourIdName -o "" -g "" @\&.\fR
.fi
.PP
.br
.PP
Verification is simply:
.PP
.nf
\f(CW    swverify -d @\&.\fR
.fi
.PP
.br
 
.SH "SECURING CVS REPOSITORIES"
.PP
Securing CVS (or any Source Code Management repository) is similar to securing a directory with
the additional step that the \fB\&./catalog/\fP directory is checked-in or committed
to the repository just like other ordinary directories in the project\&.
.PP
Slightly different options are used for signing and verification\&.  These have to do with file
ownerships which are not tracked and enforced\&.  Also the default action of removing \&./catalog
is prevented by the \fB--no-remove\fP option\&.
.PP
.nf
\f(CW    swign -D $HOME/checkdigest\&.sh -s PSF\&.in --no-remove --name-version=somepackage-1\&.0 @\&.\fR
.fi
.PP
.br
The exported directory (without the SCM control files) can be verified\&.  Since
ownerships, time stamps, and permissions are probably not preserved, use a special
option to swverify, --scm\&.
.PP
.nf
\f(CW     swverify --scm -d @\&.\fR
.fi
.PP
.br
.PP
The PSF\&.in for this usage is specialized\&.  Note the special exclude directives
and the replacement macros \fI%__tag\fP and \fI%__revision\fP which allows easy control of the current revision\&.
.PP
Here is a minimal example, the swign(1) manual page for more information\&.
.PP
.nf
\f(CW   # PSF\&.in -- Input file to swign

.fi
.PP
.br
.SH "COPYING FILES"
.PP
\fBswcopy\fP can be used to copy arbitrary files or data streams from host to host\&.
Here are a few examples\&.  See the manual page swcopy(8) for more\&.
.PP
.nf
\f(CW# Copy a file in the current directory to your home directory on HostA
   swcopy --no-audit -s :file1 @ HostA

# Copy the data stream from a device on a remote host
   swcopy --no-audit -s 192\&.168\&.1\&.1:/dev/tape @- | tar tvf -

# Show your network speed in real time
   swcopy --no-audit -s 192\&.168\&.1\&.1:/dev/zero --show-progress @ /dev/null 

# Read the entire file system on a remote host
   swcopy --no-audit -s 192\&.168\&.1\&.1:/ @- | tar tvf -\fR
.fi
.PP
.br
.SH "PACKAGE MANAGEMENT FUNCTIONS"
.PP
swbis supports typical package management functions for creation, installation,
listing/query, verification, and removal in a network transparent fashion with
zero new requirements for the remote host\&.
\fBssh\fP is used directly for host access and no special 
configuration is required\&.
.PP
The default requirements for the remote host are GNU bash, as \fB/bin/bash\fP,
and GNU tar as \fB/bin/tar\fP\&.  Other runtime and compile configurations are
possible to allow GNU tar to be \fB/bin/gtar\fP and a host to be bash-less\&.
See swbis(7) for information on support for other POSIX shells\&.
.PP
Alternate root operation is supported for all operations, however, only
cooperatively enforced for control script execution, that is control scripts
must respect its relative root\&.
.PP
All utilities are similar in their command-line interface:
.PP
.nf
\f(CW    sw<\fIutillity\fP> [\fIPKG_NAME_SPEC\fP] @ \fIHOSTNAME\fP
.br
    sw<\fIutillity\fP> [\fIPKG_NAME_SPEC\fP] @ :\fIFILENAME\fP
.br
    sw<\fIutillity\fP> [\fIPKG_NAME_SPEC\fP] @ /\fIFILENAME\fP
.br
\fR
.fi
.PP
.SS "Internal operation,  Events, and Errors"
.PP
Operation of the distributed utilites consists of a shell script running on the target host
and the actual utility running on the management host\&.
These hosts may be the same or different\&.
Configuration data (e\&.g\&. swbisdefaults and swdefaults files) are read on the
management host only\&.  When verifying installed software, gpg is invoked on the management
host only using public keys from the management host only\&. 
.PP
All the distributed utiltities operate as a utility (i\&.e\&. C program) and a shell script
read and executed from the POSIX shell\&'s standard input\&.
The C program and shell script communicate via stdin, stdout and stderr using a connection
provided by an ordinary rsh or ssh client\&.  For local operation ssh/rsh is not invoked\&.
The utilities never should be installed setuid root\&.  Privilege escalation can be accomplished
via Ssh and a UNIX user account:
.PP
.nf
\f(CW    sw<\fIutillity\fP> @ root@localhost
.br
\fR
.fi
.PP
 

The shell script is a list of tasks where each task becomes an additional shell reading from stdin\&.
Before the additional task shell is executed,
a Task Identification Header is read and compared with the expected Task\&. In addition
each task has an END event to return its status\&.  If any error occurs, the error is
detected by the utility (i\&.e\&. the C program on the management host); and, the main
script [on the target host] falls through with an error\&.

.PP
For example, here is how the \&'load fileset\&' task script appears in a UNIX process listing:
.PP
.nf
\f(CW14073 14071  1 20:35  /bin/bash -s _swbis _swinstall
14453 14073  0 20:35  /bin/bash -s /_swbis /_swinstall load fileset
14454 14453  0 20:35  dd bs 512 count 6870
14455 14453  0 20:35  /bin/bash -s /_swbis /_swinstall load fileset
14460 14455  0 20:35  tar xpvf -\fR
.fi
.PP
 
.PP
During operation events are generated\&.  They may be shown by increasing the verbosity level
.PP
.nf
\f(CW    swinstall -x verbose=3
        # -or-
    swinstall -vv\fR
.fi
.PP
 For example, the events for installation look like this
.PP
.nf
\f(CW# swinstall -x reinstall=y --no-scripts -vv @ localhost:/tmp/aabb
swinstall: SWBIS_TARGET_BEGINS for @localhost:/tmp/aabb
swinstall: SW_SESSION_BEGINS on target host Host20: 
swinstall: SW_NOT_LOCATABLE: xorg-x11-Xnest\&.xorg-x11-Xnest: status=2
swinstall: SW_ANALYSIS_BEGINS on target host Host20: 
swinstall: SW_SAME_REVISION_INSTALLED at @localhost:/tmp/aabb: status=0: var/\&.\&.\&.
swinstall: SW_DEPENDENCY_NOT_MET: prerequisite xorg-x11,pr==6\&.8\&.2: status=2
swinstall: SW_SOC_LOCK_CREATED on target host Host20: lockpath=var/\&.\&.\&.
swinstall: SW_ANALYSIS_ENDS on target host Host20: status=0
swinstall: SW_EXECUTION_BEGINS on target host Host20: 
swinstall: SW_SOC_LOCK_REMOVED on target host Host20: status=0
swinstall: SW_EXECUTION_ENDS on target host Host20: status=0
swinstall: SW_SESSION_ENDS on target host Host20: status=0
swinstall: SWBIS_TARGET_ENDS for @localhost:/tmp/aabb: status=0\fR
.fi
.PP
 Events have their own status, 0, 1, or 2\&.  Zero (0) is always sucess, 1 is an error, and
2 may be a warning or error depending on the event and options\&.
.SS "Recovery From Hangs and Crashes"
.PP
Swbis utilites never hang and never crash and are generally signal safe, that is you
can hit ctrl-C and expect a controlled exit of the remote script and utility\&.
However if a utility really crashes it can leave unwanted processes on the remote host, they
may even suck up CPU cycles making the machine slow\&.
The first step is to kill the management utility:
.PP
.nf
\f(CW   killall -9 swinstall  # or whatever the utility was\fR
.fi
.PP
 Then, to kill the task shells on the remote host:
.PP
.nf
\f(CW   swremove --cleansh @ user@Host\fR
.fi
.PP
 using the same user and host as the crashed invocation\&.  This will kill all swbis process
including other users if allowed by the system\&.
