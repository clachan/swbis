<TITLE>
SWPACKAGE INPUT FILE FORMAT
</TITLE>
<PARA>
The input file is called a product specification file or PSF.  It contains information to
direct swpackage and information that is package meta-data [that is merely transferred unchanged
into the global INDEX file]. 
</PARA>
<PARA>
A PSF may contain object keywords, attributes (keyword/value pairs) and Extended Definitions (described below).
An object keyword connotes a logical object (i.e. software structure) supported by the standard.  An object keyword
does not have a value field after it, as it contains Attributes and Extended Definitions.
An attribute keyword conotes an attribute which is always in the form of a keyword/value pair.
</PARA>
<PARA>
Attribute keywords not recognized by the standard are allowed and are transferred into the INDEX file.
Object keywords not recognized by the standard are not allowed and will generate an error.
Extended Definitions may only appear in a PSF (never in a INDEX or INFO created by swpackage).
Extended Definitions are translated [by swpackage] into object keywords (objects) and 
attributes recognized by the standard.
</PARA>
<PARA>
Comments in a PSF are not transferred into the INDEX file by the swbis implementation of swpackage.
</PARA>
<PARA>
The file syntax is the same as a <FUNCTION>INDEX</FUNCTION>, or <FUNCTION>INFO</FUNCTION> file.
A PSF may contain all objects defined by the standard as well as extended definitions.<SBR>
