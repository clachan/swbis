# File: Example PSF for source packages
#  This file may be copied without restriction.

# The distribution object is required, thought it need not
# have any attributes.

distribution
 
# Attributes in the distribution are mostly ignored by the utilities
# although distributor control files that pertain to the
# distribution as a whole are properly placed here.  Two examples
# of files that are useful here are:

AUTHORS < AUTHORS   # This places the file in ./catalog/dfiles
COPYING < COPYING   # This places the file in ./catalog/dfiles

# This places the checkdigest script in ./catalog/dfiles/checkdigest
# For a description of the checkdigest script see info 'swbis'

  checkdigest  < bin/checkdigest.sh

# The vendor object provides attributes to describe
# the distributor.  At this time, how these attributes
# are used is not addressed.

# The vendor object is optional

vendor
   the_term_vendor_is_misleading True  # One of: True, False
   tag shortName # Or use a short name of your organization of your
                       # or your initials, etc.
   title Your Name
   qualifier author
   description "Maintainer of somepackage"

# The bundle object is optional
# Most packages do not need a bundle.  At this point in swbis'
# development 'bundles' are mostly ignored.  Bundles are meta
# packages, it is an object that contains other bundles and
# products whether included in this distribution tarball or not.
# The tag is the name of the meta-package.

bundle
   tag somepackage  

# The product object contains the attributes of common
# interest such as the description, version and name.

# The product object is required.
# The product object contains the package info

product
   description "This is the 
description of your
package"
   title "Short one line description"
   tag somepackage                      # This is the package name
   revision 1.99                        # This is the package version
   vendor_tag shortName
   control_directory ""   # Empty string, Important

# The fileset object contains the files.
# The fileset.tag and revision are ignored by swbis at
# this time.

# Only a fileset object contains files, hence it is required.
fileset
    tag somepackage-sources              # Not used currently
    control_directory ""                 # Empty string, Important

    description "The source distribution of somepackage"

# file_permissions:
# 
# NOTE:  Using "file_permissions -o 0 -g 0" is preferred if
# you want the package users to more easily verify the
# directory (unpacked) form of the package using standard
# non-swbis tools.  This is accomplished by using GNU tar
# with correct options to create a byte stream that hashes
# to match the GPG signature and payload digests.

#   file_permissions -u 000  # To use ownerships of source files
    file_permissions -o 0 -g 0 # --numeric --owner=root --group=root

# The following two (2) lines mean include every file in the current
# directory.

    directory .
    file *

# You want to exclude the files in ./catalog because it
# should not be part of the payload section.

    exclude catalog   # Important

# You may also want other excludes such as:

    exclude CVS
    exclude */CVS
    # exclude .svn
    # exclude */.svn
