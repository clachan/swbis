1.3 DESCRIPTION
===============

swbisparse reads and parses POSIX.7.2 metadata files: INDEX, INFO and
psf files.

swbisparse writes an implementation defined format to stdout.  The
format indicates the keyword type, (O)bject, (A)ttribute, or,
(E)xtended, and, containment level.  Newlines in multi-line values are
translated to '\\n' and output on a single line.

When decoding a package file, package_file, swbisparse emits a format
that includes the length (in bytes) of the attribute value.  The format
consists of ASCII data.  Binary data in the input will cause an error.

     For Example, the following PSF file:

      distribution
      layout_version 1.0
      product
      description "This is a
      multi line value"
      tag p1
      fileset
      tag p2
      file
      path /etc/passwd

     is translated to:

      F00 PSF:
      O01 distribution
      A02  layout_version 1.0
      O02  product
      A03   description "This is a\\nmulti line value"
      A03   tag p1
      O03   fileset
      A04    tag p2
      O04    file
      A05     path /etc/passwd

1.3.1 Hewlett-Packard SD-UX Compatibility
-----------------------------------------

This parser does not use nor require the end keyword to terminate
objects as is commonly the practice for PSF files written for
Hewlett-Packard's SD-UX equipped systems.  The end keyword can appear
in PSF, INDEX and INFO files, however, it will merely be scanned and the
token discarded.  Another incompatibility is based on this parser's
termination of an object definition by the first extended keyword.
This restriction may not exist in the SD-UX grammar because the object
is bracketed by the nesting of end keywords and not by the existence of
the first object or extended keyword.

1.8 BUGS
========

This program is mainly a testing and development tool.

Requirements for inclusion (exclusion) of certain keywords in (from) the
parsed output is not enforced.  Quoted trailing whitespace in the
attribute value is discarded.
