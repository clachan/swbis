This is ../info/swbis.info, produced by makeinfo version 4.13 from
swbis.texi.

This manual is for swbis (version 1.13.1, 24 Jul 2014), which is an
implementation of the POSIX System Administration Standard - Part 2:
Software Administration IEEE Std 1387.2-1995 (ISO/IEC 15068-2) (both
now withdrawn) and the Open Group Specification CAE C701.  Currently,
most of the the standard is implemented.  Most notably the
implementation lacks the ability to operate on packages with multiple
fileset or products.  There are extensions for package authentication
using GNU Privacy Guard.  Extensions to the standard are indicated as
such in this document.
