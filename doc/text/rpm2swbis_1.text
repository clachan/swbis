BUGS
       No temporary files are used in the conversion process, just lots of
       memory.	This capability was created as a testing tool of swpackage.
       It seems to convert without any error messages about 95% of binary RPMs
       and nearly 100% of source RPMs.	The accuracy of the file or metadata
       after conversion has not been exhaustively confirmed.
