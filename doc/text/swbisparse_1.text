NAME
       swbisparse â€” Read and parse POSIX.7.2 metadata.

SYNOPSIS
       swbisparse {--installed|-o,--info|-i,--index|-p,--psf} [-b] [-n] [-l level] [file]

       swbisparse {-d,--decode} [package_file]

DESCRIPTION
       swbisparse reads and parses POSIX.7.2 metadata files: INDEX, INFO and
       psf files.

       swbisparse writes an implementation defined format to stdout.  The
       format indicates the keyword type, (O)bject, (A)ttribute, or,
       (E)xtended, and, containment level.  Newlines in multi-line values are
       translated to '\n' and output on a single line.

       When decoding a package file, package_file, swbisparse emits a format
       that includes the length (in bytes) of the attribute value.  The format
       consists of ASCII data.	Binary data in the input will cause an error.

       For Example, the following PSF file:

	distribution
	layout_version 1.0
	product
	description "This is a
	multi line value"
	tag p1
	fileset
	tag p2
	file
	path /etc/passwd

       is translated to:

	F00 PSF:
	O01 distribution
	A02  layout_version 1.0
	O02  product
	A03   description "This is a\nmulti line value"
	A03   tag p1
	O03   fileset
	A04    tag p2
	O04    file
	A05	path /etc/passwd

   Hewlett-Packard SD-UX Compatibility
       This parser does not use nor require the end keyword to terminate
       objects as is commonly the practice for PSF files written for Hewlett-
       Packard's SD-UX equipped systems.  The end keyword can appear in PSF,
       INDEX and INFO files, however, it will merely be scanned and the token
       discarded.  Another incompatibility is based on this parser's
       termination of an object definition by the first extended keyword.
       This restriction may not exist in the SD-UX grammar because the object
       is bracketed by the nesting of end keywords and not by the existence of
       the first object or extended keyword.

OPTIONS
       --info-o	    Parse an INFO file.

       --installed     Parse the installed software catalog file INSTALLED.

       --psf-p	   Parse a PSF file.

       --index-i     Parse an INDEX file.

       -b     Beautify by indention and emit a file
	      semantically identical to the input file.

       -n     Emit format that is marked up with the
	      value's lengths in bytes.

       -l level	    Set initial containment level
	      to level.

APPLICABLE STANDARDS
       Conforming to POSIX.7.2, however, A stand-alone parser utility by this
       (or any) name is not specified in ISO/IEC 15068-2:1999

BUGS
       This program is mainly a testing and development tool.

       Requirements for inclusion (exclusion) of certain keywords in (from)
       the parsed output is not enforced.  Quoted trailing whitespace in the
       attribute value is discarded.
