This module embeds shell functions into the ./shlib.a
library thus creating a shell code pallate.  The shell functions
can be selected individually and accessed as a null terminated string
using the routines of shlib.c

The program ./test_write.c is an example that selects all the routines
and writes them to stout.

To test the embedding of the shell_lib.sh, do
	make check

To add or edit the shell routines:
	 edit shell_lib.sh

shell_lib.c is automatically generated by ./gencfile
from shell_lib.sh

Usage:
	gencfile --compression={0|1} <shell_lib.sh >shell_lib.c

Compression may be used by swbis to embed the shell library in the
swinstall binary (actually ./shlib.a).  There is little reason to do this
other than to save a little space, and gain some obscurity for the shell code.

Set COMPRESSION={0|1} in ./Makefile.in to set compression policy

Examples of Using Test Programs
--------------------------------
The test programs use a sample installed software catalog
at ../../tests/examples/installed_software

sh ./test_isc_01.sh  --soc-spec1=unit --revision=1.8,1.81 --relop=">,<="


To see the dependency check internal format:

SWBIS_LIST_FORM=lform_dep1 sh test_isc_03.sh
