	title			POSIX 1387.2 Software Administration Utilities
	description		"The objective of this standard is to address this problem
for software administration, a specific area of system administration, and to
contribute to the overall solution of administering computing environments, both stand
alone and distributed.

In pursuit of this goal, this standard defines a set of utilities, a set of objects acted
upon by those utilities, a set of information maintained about installed software, and the
layout on a physical medium of software awaiting installation.
These definitions provide the flexibility necessary for system administrators to enforce
policies suitable for their environments."
