uxfio - unix extended file i/o module


UXFIO provides a set of functions that try to be identical to 
the Unix Standard File and I/O primitives.  The uxfio function
has the prefix 'uxfio_' prepended to the standard Unix function
name.  Function prototypes are the identical to the Unix
counterpart.

The compelling feature of UXFIO is the ability to seek to
an extent defined by its file buffer, this is helpful when
using pipes which cannot be seeked on.

It can also be used to create tmp files, simply set buffer type
to BUFTYPE_FILE and read to the end of the file.

For simple common usages of read(3), open(3), close(3) it is a
drop in replacement for contexts except where the uxfio file
descriptor number must be shared among processes.

To make the interactive test program.
    make -f Makefile.std tests

Otherwise make just the library uxfio.a
    make -f Makefile.std

Look at sample.c as a guide to using uxfio, sample.c reverses stdin.
